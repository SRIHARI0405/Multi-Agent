# AI Implementation Analysis for Tata

## 1. Industry and Company Research
# Company Analysis: Tata Steel

Tata Steel is a leading steel manufacturing company, part of the Tata Group, one of India's largest multinational conglomerates. The company operates in 26 countries with key operations in India, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, employing around 80,500 people. Its largest plant, with a 10 MTPA capacity, is located in Jamshedpur, Jharkhand, India.

## Business Model

- Tata Steel has made numerous domestic and international acquisitions, which have increased the company's debt but also expanded its reach and capacity.
- Tata Steel, SAIL, and Jindal Steel and Power are the only three Indian steel companies that have captive iron-ore mines, which gives these companies price advantages.
- Tata Steel has a complex holding structure, which the management decided to simplify in September to save costs. This is expected to result in cost reduction of Rs. 1,000 to 1,500 crores every year by the amalgamation of 7 companies into one.

# Key Offerings

- Tata Steel is the largest steel company in India (measured by domestic production) with an annual capacity of 21.6 million tonnes.
- The company has a significant presence in the tinplate industry in India, holding a 70% market share and exporting a fourth of its products outside India.
- Tata Steel's production and sales reached 360,000 tons in 2018â€“19.

# Strategic Focus Areas

- Tata Steel has announced expansion plans, with an additional capacity of 3,00,000 tons per annum planned.
- The company is focusing on environmental sustainability, aiming to cover 100% of its sites under Biodiversity Management Plans across India, UK, and Netherlands by 2025 and striving for no net loss of biodiversity in designated areas of influence in India by 2030.
- Tata Steel is also working towards achieving specific freshwater consumption targets across all steel making sites in India by 2025 and 2030.
- The company aims to achieve 25% diversity in its workforce for Tata Steel Limited by 2025 and reach more than 10 million lives per annum through Corporate Social Responsibility initiatives by 2030.
- Tata Steel is also focusing on technology, aiming to be amongst the top 5 in technology in the steel industry globally by 2030.
- The company is also working on integrating Environment, Social, and Governance performance of critical supply chain partners in procurement decision-making by 2030.

## 2. AI/ML Use Cases
1. Title: AI-Powered Predictive Maintenance for Steel Manufacturing Equipment
   Business Problem: Unplanned downtime due to equipment failure can lead to significant production losses and increased costs.
   Proposed Solution: Implement an AI-based predictive maintenance system that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze data from sensors on the equipment, predict potential failures, and schedule maintenance before breakdowns occur.
   Expected Benefits: Reduced downtime, increased operational efficiency, and cost savings.
   Implementation Considerations: The implementation would require installing sensors on the equipment, collecting and storing data, and training the machine learning model. It would also require integration with the existing maintenance management system.

2. Title: AI for Environmental Sustainability Monitoring
   Business Problem: Tata Steel is committed to environmental sustainability but monitoring compliance across multiple sites can be challenging and resource-intensive.
   Proposed Solution: Use AI and machine learning to analyze data from various sources (e.g., satellite images, sensor data) to monitor environmental impact and compliance with sustainability goals.
   Expected Benefits: Improved monitoring and compliance, early detection of potential issues, and support for sustainability reporting.
   Implementation Considerations: This would require access to relevant data sources, development or acquisition of AI models capable of analyzing the data, and integration with existing environmental management systems.

3. Title: AI for Diversity and Inclusion in Hiring
   Business Problem: Tata Steel aims to achieve 25% diversity in its workforce by 2025 but traditional hiring practices may not be sufficient to reach this goal.
   Proposed Solution: Implement an AI-powered recruitment tool that can help identify diverse candidates, reduce unconscious bias in the hiring process, and track progress towards diversity goals.
   Expected Benefits: Increased diversity, improved hiring efficiency, and support for corporate social responsibility initiatives.
   Implementation Considerations: This would require integration with existing HR systems, training for HR staff on the use of the tool, and ongoing monitoring to ensure the tool is not introducing new biases.

4. Title: AI for Supply Chain Risk Management
   Business Problem: Tata Steel aims to integrate Environment, Social, and Governance performance of critical supply chain partners in procurement decision-making by 2030, but manual monitoring and evaluation can be time-consuming and error-prone.
   Proposed Solution: Implement an AI-based system that can analyze data from various sources (e.g., supplier reports, news articles, social media) to assess supply chain risks and provide actionable insights.
   Expected Benefits: Improved risk management, more informed procurement decisions, and support for corporate social responsibility initiatives.
   Implementation Considerations: This would require access to relevant data sources, development or acquisition of AI models capable of analyzing the data, and integration with existing procurement and risk management systems.
